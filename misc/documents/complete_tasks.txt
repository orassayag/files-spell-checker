-If unable to open/read the file, catch the exception and continue to the next file. *
-Both: *
-Clear special symboles (not include .,`) and all none-English characters. *
-Ignore words that contain only numbers (at least 2 English characters in a row). *
-The console log status will look like this: *
===[SETTINGS] Time: 00.05:16:58 [-] | Method: NAME | Ignore Words: 45 | Ignore Paths: 10=== *
===[GENERAL] Current: 104,342,450/454,334,500 (31.60%) | Status: SCAN/PAUSE/FINISH=== *
===[ITEMS] Total: ✅ 1,412 | Misspell: ❌ 23 | Skip: 143,434 | Error: 1=== *
===[WORDS] Total: 473,345,994 | Misspell: 1,348 | Ignore: 3=== *
===[NAME] complete_tasks.txt=== (cut the path if too long) *
===[PATH] C:\Or\Web\sender\sender\misc\documents\=== (cut the path if too long) *
6. Delay in milliseconds between each file scan. *
-The log structure will be identical to all: *
C:\Or\Web\sender\sender\misc\documents\complete_tasks.txt *
task => task, tak, te. *
task => task, tak, te. *
================================ *
-Limit each log file to a number of misspells (5000) - From settings.js. *
7. Limit the number of characters of path in console status log. *
-Ignore words that contain 1 character. *
-Build the backup logic. *
-Build the function that checks words and returns the result. *

-This might help: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37523267/javascript-regex-how-to-single-out-english-words-and-non-english-characters-and *
-There will be general settings.js for both scripts: *
1. Scan the files according to a given path. *
2. Ignore words list. *
3. Ignore paths list. *
4. Limit files count to check. *
-Test the "typo-js" npm package. *
-Add options to limit the number of files to scan - canceled. *
